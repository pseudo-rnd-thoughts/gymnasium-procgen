### Description

The player starts as a small fish and becomes bigger by eating other
fish. The player may only eat fish smaller than itself, as determined
solely by width. If the player comes in contact with a larger fish,
the player is eaten and the episode ends. The player receives a small
reward for eating a smaller fish and a large reward for becoming
bigger than all other fish, at which point the episode ends.

### Action Space

The action space is `Discrete(15)` for which button combo to press.
The button combos are defined in [`env.py`](procgen/env.py).

The different combos are:

| Num | Combo        | Action          |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| 0   | LEFT + DOWN  | Move down-left  |
| 1   | LEFT         | Move left       |
| 2   | LEFT + UP    | Move up-left    |
| 3   | DOWN         | Move down       |
| 4   |              | Do Nothing      |
| 5   | UP           | Move up         |
| 6   | RIGHT + DOWN | Move down-right |
| 7   | RIGHT        | Move right      |
| 8   | RIGHT + UP   | Move up-right   |
| 9   | D            | Unused          |
| 10  | A            | Unused          |
| 11  | W            | Unused          |
| 12  | S            | Unused          |
| 13  | Q            | Unused          |
| 14  | E            | Unused          |

### Observation Space

The observation space is a box space with the RGB pixels the agent
sees in an `ndarray` of shape `(64, 64, 3)` with dtype `uint8`.

**Note**: If you are using the vectorized environment, the
observation space is a dictionary space where the pixels are under
the key "rgb".

### Rewards

A `+1` reward is given for each fish eaten.
A further `+10` is assigned after successfully completing one
episode.

### Termination

The episode ends if any one of the following conditions is met:

1. The player is eaten (collide with a larger fish).
2. The player is big enough to eat all the fish (reaches quota).
3. Timeout is reached.

### Known Issues

It is possible for the player to occasionally become trapped
along the borders of the environment.
